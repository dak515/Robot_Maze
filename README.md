# Robot_Maze

This project aims to demonstrate -

- Recursion

A robot is asked to navigate a maze. It is placed at a certain position (the starting position) in the maze and is asked to try to reach another position (the goal position). The robot should search for a path from the starting position to the goal position (a solution path) until it finds one or until it exhausts all possibilities. In addition, it should mark the path it finds (if any) in the maze.
